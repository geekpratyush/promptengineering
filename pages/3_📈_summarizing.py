been using it for twice daily brushing for the last \

is too small. I‚Äôve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than \
this one. I wish the head was bigger with different \

this one doesn‚Äôt.  Overall if you can get this one \
around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's \

get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This \

half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \

So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn‚Äôt look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.""",height=100)
