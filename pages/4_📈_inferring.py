                The results revealed that NASA was the most popular 
                department with a satisfaction rating of 95%.

                One NASA employee, John Smith, commented on the findings, 
                stating, "I'm not surprised that NASA came out on top. 
                It's a great place to work with amazing people and 
                incredible opportunities. I'm proud to be a part of 
                such an innovative organization.

                The results were also welcomed by NASA's management team, 
                with Director Tom Johnson stating, "We are thrilled to 
                hear that our employees are satisfied with their work at NASA. 
                We have a talented and dedicated team who work tirelessly 
                to achieve our goals, and it's fantastic to see that their 
                hard work is paying off.

                The survey also revealed that the 
                Social Security Administration had the lowest satisfaction 
                rating, with only 45% of employees indicating they were 
                satisfied with their job. The government has pledged to 
                address the concerns raised by employees in the survey and
